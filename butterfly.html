            <p>In the Flutter of Butterflies at teamLab Borderless, the butterflies come to life through people, swaying and twirling in the open space. When the Butterfly House is empty, it's just a dark void. But once people step in and stay still, magic happens. Butterflies pop up on them, and butterflies flutter to their feet and hands. The catch is that these butterflies die when humans touch them and are not spawned again. This interactive art piece is all live and powered by a computer program. Viewer interaction keeps the artwork in constant flow. The design is meant to replicate this idea in a real world environment.</p>

                  <p>In their natural habitat, butterflies engage in peaceful interactions, contributing to the ecosystem's delicate balance. Their graceful movements play a crucial role in pollination and the overall health of the environment.</p>

                  <h1>PHASE 2</h1>
                  <p>During rainfall, butterflies exhibit adaptive behavior by seeking shelter near plants. This behavior is driven by their instinct to protect themselves from the rain, demonstrating their ability to respond to environmental changes and maintain resilience in adverse conditions.</p>

                  <h1>PHASE 3</h1>
                  <p>While butterflies may exhibit a degree of attraction to humans due to various factors, they simultaneously harbor a fear rooted in self-preservation. Their delicate nature makes them vulnerable to the touch of humans, emphasizing the intricacies of coexistence and the potential impact of human interaction on these fragile creatures.

                  <p> When butterflies die by human touch, it damages the whole ecosystem. See what happens when they all die.</p>
