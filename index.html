                  <h1>PHASE 1</h1>
                  <p>In their natural habitat, butterflies engage in peaceful interactions, contributing to the ecosystem's delicate balance. Their graceful movements play a crucial role in pollination and the overall health of the environment.</p>

                <div class="box">
                  <h1>PHASE 2</h1>
                  <p>During rainfall, butterflies exhibit adaptive behavior by seeking shelter near plants. This behavior is driven by their instinct to protect themselves from the elements, demonstrating their ability to respond to environmental changes and maintain resilience in adverse conditions.</p>

                <div class="box">
                  <h1>PHASE 3</h1>
                  <p>While butterflies may exhibit a degree of attraction to humans due to various factors, they simultaneously harbor a fear rooted in self-preservation. Their delicate nature makes them vulnerable to the touch of humans, emphasizing the intricacies of coexistence and the potential impact of human interaction on these fragile creatures.
